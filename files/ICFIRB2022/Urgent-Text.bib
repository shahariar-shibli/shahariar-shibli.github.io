abstract="This paper presents a learning approach on a unique dataset formulated by authors that detects urgent texts from the posts on social media platforms in Bengali language. It is difficult to keep track of every information we go through social media. In the collision of numerous posts, it is easy to miss information that is urgent. In this advanced era of machine learning, detecting urgent texts among thousands of posts would be much easier if we can implement a model that can filter the urgent text out of them. Therefore, we propose an approach that can identify any type of urgent texts from public posts by leveraging a manually constructed dataset that is fully human annotated. Apart from traditional machine learning classifiers, we applied boosting algorithms in our proposed method in addition. Experimentally, a significant increase in accuracy has been noticed by boosting weak learners. Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieved 80.9{\%} accuracy where gradient boosting outperformed the traditional approach with 82{\%} accuracy while detecting urgent texts in Bengali language.",
