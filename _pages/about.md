<span style="color:black; font-family:Monaco">Greetings! ðŸ‘½</span>

<p style="text-align:justify; color:black; font-family:Monaco">I am currently employed as 
a <a href="https://aust.edu/cse/faculty_member/mr_g_m_shahariar">Senior Lecturer</a> at the Department of CSE, 
<a href="https://aust.edu/">Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology</a>. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and 
Engineering from the same university. My career aspiration is to become a scientist and work in leading AI research laboratories. 
I am particularly interested in developing NLP solutions for processing human languages, with a focus on languages that have limited 
resources. I find enjoyment in competitive programming and have managed to solve over 1000 problems on various online judges.</p>


<p style="text-align:justify;color:black; font-family:Monaco">
<b>Research</b>. In the era of artificial intelligence (AI), creating effective natural language processing (NLP) systems demands 
abundant annotated data. However, the challenge lies in the fact that most large-scale labeled datasets are only available for 
a few languages, leaving low-resource languages like Bengali with limited or no annotations, hindering the adoption of advanced 
NLP techniques. My main goal is to pioneer innovative approaches that tackle this scarcity of labeled data and resources in 
Bengali NLP, covering areas like natural language generation, summarization, question answering (QA), and interpretability of 
language models. I intend to utilize cutting-edge techniques like generative and contrastive learning to improve language generation 
and representation learning for Bengali. Additionally, I've also applied natural language processing in specific software engineering 
(SE) tasks.
