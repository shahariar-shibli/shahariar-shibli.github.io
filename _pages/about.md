Greetings! ðŸ‘½

<p style="text-align:justify">I am a graduate student at <a href="https://www.buet.ac.bd/">Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology</a>, 
where I am doing research on <em>Memory Efficient Retriever Augmented Open-Domain Question Answering Through Web Search and Summarization</em> under the supervision of <a href="https://cse.buet.ac.bd/faculty_list/detail/rifat">Dr. Rifat Shahriyar</a>.
I completed my Bachelor of Science in CSE from <a href="https://aust.edu/">Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology</a> and 
currently working as a <a href="https://aust.edu/cse/faculty_member/mr_g_m_shahariar">Senior Lecturer</a> here at the Department of CSE.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">My area of research focuses on utilizing natural language processing in <em>low-resource language</em> settings. 
Throughout the past few years, I have engaged in several projects focused on <em>natural language generation</em>, <em>question answering</em>, 
<em>summarization</em>, <em>representation learning</em>, <em>NLP applications</em> and <em>software engineering</em>. 
I am particularly interested in explaining how machine learning models arrive at a specific prediction and 
enhancing the ability of a model to learn data representation during training. I also find interests in working with <em>medical imaging</em>.</p>
