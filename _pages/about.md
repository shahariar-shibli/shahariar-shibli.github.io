<span style="color:black; font-family:Georgia">Greetings! ðŸ‘½</span>

<p style="text-align:justify; color:black; font-family:Georgia">I am  G M Shahariar Shibli (<button onclick="playMusic()" style='font-size:16px'>pronounce <i class='fas fa-volume-up'></i></button>) currently employed as 
a <a href="https://aust.edu/cse/faculty_member/mr_g_m_shahariar">Lecturer (Grade-I)</a> at the Department of CSE, 
<a href="https://aust.edu/">Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology</a>. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and 
Engineering from the same university. My career aspiration is to work in leading AI research laboratories. <span style="color:red;">I am looking for a Ph.D. position in Fall 2024</span>.
</p>


<p style="text-align:justify;color:black; font-family:Georgia">
<b>Research</b>. My research works are intended to tackle low resource Bengali NLP, covering areas like <em>natural language generation</em>, <em>summarization</em>, <em>question answering (QA)</em>, 
and <em>interpretability of language models</em>. I have utilized cutting-edge techniques like <em>generative</em> and 
<em>contrastive learning</em> to improve language generation and <em>representation learning</em> for Bengali. 
Additionally, I have also applied natural language processing in specific <em>software engineering (SE)</em> tasks. At present, I am investigating bias, fairness and adversarial robustness in PLMs and LLMs.
<span style="color:red;">I am always available and will be more than happy to collaborate. Please feel free to email.</span>
