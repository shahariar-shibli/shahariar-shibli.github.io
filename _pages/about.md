<span style="color:black; font-family:Georgia">Greetings! ðŸ‘½</span>

<p style="text-align:justify; color:black; font-family:Georgia">I am  G M Shahariar Shibli (<button onclick="playMusic()" style='font-size:16px'>pronounce <i class='fas fa-volume-up'></i></button>), a 
first year PhD Student in the Computer Science and Engineering department at the <a href="https://www1.cs.ucr.edu/">University of California, Riverside</a>. 
I am currently working in the Natural Language Processing group at UCR and very fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://yuedong.us/">Professor Yue Dong</a>. 
At present, I am investigating bias, fairness and safety in LLMs and Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models. </p>


<p>Prior to that I worked as a Lecturer at the Department of CSE, Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in CSE from the same university. 
My career aspiration is to work in leading AI research laboratories. <span style="color:green;"><em>I am open to the possibility of collaboration. Feel free to email.</em></p>


<p style="text-align:justify;color:black; font-family:Georgia">
My past research works were intended to tackle low resource NLP, covering areas like <em>natural language generation</em>, <em>summarization</em>, <em>question answering (QA)</em>, 
and <em>interpretability of language models</em>. I had utilized cutting-edge techniques like <em>generative</em> and 
<em>contrastive learning</em> to improve language generation and <em>representation learning</em> for low resource language. 
Additionally, I had applied natural language processing in specific <em>software engineering (SE)</em> tasks.</span>
