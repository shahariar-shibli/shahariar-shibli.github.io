<span style="color:black; font-family:Calisto MT">Greetings! ðŸ‘½</span>

<p style="text-align:justify; color:black; font-family:Calisto MT">I am currently employed as 
a <a href="https://aust.edu/cse/faculty_member/mr_g_m_shahariar">Senior Lecturer</a> at the Department of CSE, 
<a href="https://aust.edu/">Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology</a>. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and 
Engineering from the same university. My career aspiration is to become a scientist and work in leading AI research laboratories. 
I am particularly interested in developing NLP solutions for processing human languages, with a focus on languages that have limited 
resources. I find enjoyment in competitive programming and have managed to solve over 1000 problems on various online judges.</p>


<p style="text-align:justify;color:black; font-family:Calisto MT">
<b>Research</b>. In the era of artificial intelligence (AI), creating effective natural language processing (NLP) systems demands 
abundant annotated data. However, the challenge lies in the fact that most large-scale labeled datasets are only available for 
a few languages, leaving low-resource languages like Bengali with limited or no annotations, hindering the adoption of advanced 
NLP techniques. My main goal is to pioneer innovative approaches that tackle this scarcity of labeled data and resources in 
Bengali NLP, covering areas like <em>natural language generation</em>, <em>summarization</em>, <em>question answering (QA)</em>, 
and <em>interpretability of language models</em>. I intend to utilize cutting-edge techniques like <em>generative</em> and 
<em>contrastive learning</em> to improve language generation and <em>representation learning</em> for Bengali. 
Additionally, I have also applied natural language processing in specific <em>software engineering (SE)</em> tasks.

<p style="text-align:justify;color:black; font-family:Calisto MT">
<b>Collaboration</b>.  In my research journey, I have recognized the importance of collaboration. Alongside my B.Sc. supervisor and 
colleagues, I have worked with researchers from various institutes. Notable collaborations include 
<a href="https://aust.edu/cse/faculty_member/mr_g_m_shahariar">Dr. Gias Uddin</a> and 
<a href="https://aust.edu/cse/faculty_member/mr_g_m_shahariar">Dr. Anindya Iqbal</a> on an accepted SE paper for ASE 2023. I also 
had the privilege of working with <a href="https://aust.edu/cse/faculty_member/mr_g_m_shahariar">Dr. Hasanul Kabir</a> on a Bengali toxic 
comments classification paper that received the best paper award in ECCE 2023. Additionally, 
<a href="https://aust.edu/cse/faculty_member/mr_g_m_shahariar">Dr. Hasan Mahmud</a> and I collaborated on two papers related to the 
semi-supervised recipe genre categorization task. Currently, I am actively engaged with 
<a href="https://aust.edu/cse/faculty_member/mr_g_m_shahariar">Dr. Rifat Shahriyar</a> in exploring knowledge augmentation for open 
domain question answering. Moreover, I have made significant contributions to a funded project involving 
<a href="https://aust.edu/cse/faculty_member/mr_g_m_shahariar">Dr. Shahriar Mahbub</a>, co-authoring one paper and being the first 
author on another, focused on Bengali fake review dataset preparation and benchmark classification systems development.
