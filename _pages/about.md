<span style="color:black; font-family:Georgia">Greetings! ðŸ‘½</span>

<p style="text-align:justify; color:black; font-family:Georgia">I am currently employed as 
a <a href="https://aust.edu/cse/faculty_member/mr_g_m_shahariar">Lecturer (Grade-I)</a> at the Department of CSE, 
<a href="https://aust.edu/">Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology</a>. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and 
Engineering from the same university. My career aspiration is to work in leading AI research laboratories. <span style="color:red;">I am looking for a Ph.D. position in Fall 2024</span>.
</p>


<p style="text-align:justify;color:black; font-family:Georgia">
<b>Research</b>. My research works are intended to tackle low resource Bengali NLP, covering areas like <em>natural language generation</em>, <em>summarization</em>, <em>question answering (QA)</em>, 
and <em>interpretability of language models</em>. I have utilized cutting-edge techniques like <em>generative</em> and 
<em>contrastive learning</em> to improve language generation and <em>representation learning</em> for Bengali. 
Additionally, I have also applied natural language processing in specific <em>software engineering (SE)</em> tasks. At present, I am investigating bias, fairness and adversarial robustness in PLMs and LLMs.
<span style="color:red;">I am always available and will be more than happy to collaborate. Please feel free to email me.</span>
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;color:black; font-family:Georgia">
<b>Collaboration</b>.  In my research journey, I have recognized the importance of collaboration. Alongside my B.Sc. supervisor and 
colleagues, I have worked with researchers from various institutes. Notable collaborations include 
<a href="https://giasuddin.ca/">Dr. Gias Uddin</a> and 
<a href="https://cse.buet.ac.bd/faculty_list/detail/anindyaiqbal">Dr. Anindya Iqbal</a> on an accepted SE paper for ASE 2023. I also 
had the privilege of working with <a href="https://cse.iutoic-dhaka.edu/profile/hasanul">Dr. Md. Hasanul Kabir</a> on a Bengali toxic 
comments classification paper that received the best paper award in ECCE 2023. Additionally, 
<a href="https://cse.iutoic-dhaka.edu/profile/hasan/education">Dr. Hasan Mahmud</a> and I collaborated on two papers related to the 
semi-supervised recipe genre categorization task. Currently, I am actively engaged with 
<a href="http://rifatshahriyar.github.io/">Dr. Rifat Shahriyar</a> in exploring knowledge augmentation for open 
domain question answering. Moreover, I have made significant contributions to a funded project involving 
<a href="https://www.aust.edu/cse/faculty_member/dr_md_shahriar_mahbub">Dr. Md. Shahriar Mahbub</a>, co-authoring one paper and being the first 
author on another, focused on Bengali fake review dataset preparation and benchmark classification systems development.
