## Figurative Language Processing
Figurative language is prevalent in all aspects of human activity and discourse, from poetry and everyday 
conversation to scientific literature and  social media. The study of figurative language in NLP, which covers 
computational modeling of metaphors, idioms, puns, irony, sarcasm, similes, and other forms, is a rapidly 
expanding field.  Its widespread use is supported by various corpus studies, and its significance in human 
reasoning has been verified through psychological research. Therefore, figurative language is a crucial area 
of study for both computational and cognitive linguistics, and its automatic identification, understanding, 
and generation are essential for any NLP application that deals with semantics.
