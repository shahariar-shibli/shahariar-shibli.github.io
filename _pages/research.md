My research delves into the realms of natural language processing (NLP), encompassing both generation (NLG) 
and understanding (NLU). I aim to leverage contemporary NLP applications across diverse languages and 
fields in my research endeavors. Some of the research areas I have worked on or am currently working on 
are listed below.
</p>

## 1. Robust NLP
<p style="text-align:justify; color:black; font-family:Georgia">
Recent research indicates that numerous natural language processing (NLP) systems exhibit sensitivity and 
susceptibility to minor input alterations, adversarial attacks, etc. leading to challenges in 
generalizing across diverse datasets. This lack of robustness poses significant obstacles to the practical 
deployment of NLP systems. Ongoing work involves investigating the robustness of low resource language models 
aiming to improve generalization.

## 2. Trustworthy NLP
<p style="text-align:justify; color:black; font-family:Georgia">
Trustworthy NLP refers to natural language processing systems that exhibit a high level of reliability, accuracy, 
and credibility in their output. In the context of hallucination mitigation and factual error correction 
in text summarization, trustworthy NLP entails the ability to effectively identify and rectify misleading 
or incorrect information present in the generated summaries. Hallucination mitigation involves the prevention 
of the generation of fictitious or misleading content, ensuring that the summary accurately reflects the 
input text. Factual error correction, on the other hand, focuses on detecting and rectifying inaccuracies 
or false claims within the summary to enhance its overall trustworthiness and informativeness. By incorporating 
robust mechanisms for hallucination mitigation and factual error correction, trustworthy NLP systems can 
provide users with more reliable and accurate summaries while maintaining a high standard of credibility.

## 3. Bias & Fairness
<p style="text-align:justify; color:black; font-family:Georgia">
The majority of AI systems and algorithms are data-driven and require data to be trained on. If the 
underlying training data has biases, the algorithms trained on it will learn about them and incorporate 
them into their predictions. As a result, existing biases in data might alter the algorithms that use the 
data, resulting in biased results. This can have significant implications, such as perpetuating 
discrimination or unfair treatment based on factors like race, gender, or socioeconomic status. 
To mitigate these issues, it is crucial to implement techniques such as bias detection and fairness-aware 
machine learning. Ongoing work involves investigating gender biases in low resource pre-trained language models 
aiming to promote fairness in AI outcomes.

## 4. Misinformation Detection
<p style="text-align:justify; color:black; font-family:Georgia">
Misinformation detection in NLP refers to the use of computational techniques to identify false or 
misleading information within text data. This is achieved through algorithms that analyze 
patterns in language, context, and other linguistic cues that might indicate whether the information is 
trustworthy or not. The importance of misinformation detection lies in its role in combating the spread of 
fake news, fake reviews, propaganda, and other forms of deceptive content that can influence public opinion, undermine 
trust in legitimate news sources, and sway political, economic, or social outcomes. With the increasing 
volume of information disseminated online, it has become crucial to develop robust NLP tools to automatically 
flag and filter out misinformation to maintain the integrity of public discourse and protect individuals 
from being misled by false narratives.

## 5. Sentiment and Social Media Analysis
<p style="text-align:justify; color:black; font-family:Georgia">
Computational approaches to sentiment analysis and social media analysis involve the use of natural language 
processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to extract and analyze sentiments, opinions, and emotions 
from textual data. Social media analysis encompasses a broader scope, analyzing not only the sentiment but 
also the content, trends, and patterns within social media data. It utilizes similar NLP and machine learning 
methods to extract information about user behavior, trending topics, network interactions, and the spread of 
information. Furthermore, social network analysis tools can help identify influential users, communities, 
and the structure of interactions. Both sentiment analysis and social media analysis provide valuable 
insights for businesses, policymakers, and researchers to understand public opinion, monitor brand reputation, 
and study social dynamics.

## 6. Summarization
<p style="text-align:justify; color:black; font-family:Georgia">
In scenarios where multiple pretrained language models (PLMs) are available for text summarization, 
choosing the "best" can be challenging due to the variability in their performance depending on the 
context and nature of the text. Instead, an ensemble approach can be taken, where a variety of summaries 
generated by different PLMs are ranked to identify the most informative and coherent summary. TextRank-based 
algorithms, which are inspired by the PageRank algorithm, can be particularly useful in this ensemble 
framework. By modeling the problem as a graph with summaries as nodes and similarities between them as edges, 
TextRank can iteratively score each summary based on its similarity to other highly-scored summaries. 
This process naturally filters out redundant information and promotes summaries that capture the essence 
of the text from multiple perspectives. The highest-ranked summary according to TextRank can then be selected 
as the output, providing an effective way to harness the strengths of various PLMs while minimizing their 
individual biases and errors. This unsupervised approach does not require labeled training data, making it 
a versatile and practical solution for improving the quality of machine-generated text summarization.

## 7. Natural Language based Software Engineering
<p style="text-align:justify; color:black; font-family:Georgia">
Natural Language Processing (NLP) based Software Engineering is an emerging area that integrates NLP techniques 
into the software development process to enhance the understanding, creation, and maintenance of software. 
Leveraging the power of NLP, developers and engineers can automate and improve tasks such as extracting 
requirements from documentation, generating code from natural language descriptions, analyzing user feedback 
and bug reports, and maintaining clear and up-to-date documentation. This approach aims to bridge the gap 
between human language and computer code, allowing for more efficient communication between stakeholders, 
reducing errors, and streamlining the overall software lifecycle. The use of NLP in software engineering 
has the potential to significantly increase productivity and improve the accuracy and quality of software 
products, although it also presents challenges in accurately interpreting the vast and nuanced human language 
within the context of software development.

## 8. Online Abuse and Harms
<p style="text-align:justify; color:black; font-family:Georgia">
While digital technologies have revolutionized how we connect and communicate, they have also given a megaphone 
to harmful content like hate speech, toxic comments, abusive and harmful content. The vastness of online 
information makes it impossible to address this issue manually, requiring large-scale solutions like computer 
tools. However, identifying and moderating these harmful online activities is no easy feat, presenting complex 
technical, social, legal, and ethical challenges.

## 9. Figurative Language Processing
<p style="text-align:justify; color:black; font-family:Georgia">
Figurative language is prevalent in all aspects of human activity and discourse, from poetry and everyday 
conversation to scientific literature and  social media. The study of figurative language in NLP, which covers 
computational modeling of metaphors, idioms, puns, irony, sarcasm, similes, and other forms, is a rapidly 
expanding field.  Its widespread use is supported by various corpus studies, and its significance in human 
reasoning has been verified through psychological research. Therefore, figurative language is a crucial area 
of study for both computational and cognitive linguistics, and its automatic identification, understanding, 
and generation are essential for any NLP application that deals with semantics.

## 10. Text Normalization
<p style="text-align:justify; color:black; font-family:Georgia">
Text normalization in Natural Language Processing (NLP) refers to the process of converting the text into a 
more consistent and standard form. Back transliteration is a specific type of text normalization that involves 
converting transliterated text (text that has been converted from one script to another) back to its original 
script. Back transliteration is a complex task, as it requires a deep understanding of the phonetics and 
orthography of both the source and target languages. For instance, multiple characters or sounds from the 
original script might be represented by the same character in the Latin script, making it difficult to 
determine the correct original character during back transliteration. Additionally, the process may need 
to handle ambiguities and variations in the way people transliterate text.

## 11. Explainable AI (XAI)
<p style="text-align:justify; color:black; font-family:Georgia">
Explainable AI in medical image processing, especially when using pretrained models, refers to the ability 
of the AI system to not only accurately classify medical conditions from images but also to provide insights 
into the reasoning behind its decisions. For instance, in brain tumor classification, the AI would not only 
identify the presence of a tumor but also highlight the features in the brain scans that led to its conclusion. 
Similarly, for cervical cancer classification, the AI would analyze pap smear or HPV test images and explain 
which patterns or irregularities suggest cancerous changes. In the case of gastrointestinal disease 
classification, the AI would examine endoscopic images and point out the abnormalities, such as ulcers or 
polyps, that signify a particular disease. The 'explainable' part means that the model's decision-making 
process is transparent and understandable to human experts, allowing healthcare professionals to trust and 
effectively interpret the AI's analysis for better patient outcomes. This is particularly important in 
healthcare, where the reasoning behind a diagnosis can be as crucial as the diagnosis itself.
