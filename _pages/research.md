## Misinformation Detection
<p style="text-align:justify; color:black; font-family:Georgia">
Misinformation detection in NLP refers to the use of computational techniques to identify false or 
misleading information within text data. This is achieved through algorithms that analyze 
patterns in language, context, and other linguistic cues that might indicate whether the information is 
trustworthy or not. The importance of misinformation detection lies in its role in combating the spread of 
fake news, fake reviews, propaganda, and other forms of deceptive content that can influence public opinion, undermine 
trust in legitimate news sources, and sway political, economic, or social outcomes. With the increasing 
volume of information disseminated online, it has become crucial to develop robust NLP tools to automatically 
flag and filter out misinformation to maintain the integrity of public discourse and protect individuals 
from being misled by false narratives.

## Text Normalization
<p style="text-align:justify; color:black; font-family:Georgia">
Text normalization in Natural Language Processing (NLP) refers to the process of converting the text into a 
more consistent and standard form. Back transliteration is a specific type of text normalization that involves 
converting transliterated text (text that has been converted from one script to another) back to its original 
script. Back transliteration is a complex task, as it requires a deep understanding of the phonetics and 
orthography of both the source and target languages. For instance, multiple characters or sounds from the 
original script might be represented by the same character in the Latin script, making it difficult to 
determine the correct original character during back transliteration. Additionally, the process may need 
to handle ambiguities and variations in the way people transliterate text.

## Low Resource Methods for NLP

## Summarization 

## Online Abuse and Harms
<p style="text-align:justify; color:black; font-family:Georgia">
While digital technologies have revolutionized how we connect and communicate, they have also given a megaphone 
to harmful content like hate speech, toxic comments, abusive and harmful content. The vastness of online 
information makes it impossible to address this issue manually, requiring large-scale solutions like computer 
tools. However, identifying and moderating these harmful online activities is no easy feat, presenting complex 
technical, social, legal, and ethical challenges.

## Figurative Language Processing
<p style="text-align:justify; color:black; font-family:Georgia">
Figurative language is prevalent in all aspects of human activity and discourse, from poetry and everyday 
conversation to scientific literature and  social media. The study of figurative language in NLP, which covers 
computational modeling of metaphors, idioms, puns, irony, sarcasm, similes, and other forms, is a rapidly 
expanding field.  Its widespread use is supported by various corpus studies, and its significance in human 
reasoning has been verified through psychological research. Therefore, figurative language is a crucial area 
of study for both computational and cognitive linguistics, and its automatic identification, understanding, 
and generation are essential for any NLP application that deals with semantics.
