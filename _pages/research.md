> <p style="text-align:justify">"I think it's much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers which might be wrong. 
I have approximate answers and possible beliefs and different degrees of uncertainty about different things, 
but I am not absolutely sure of anything and there are many things I don't know anything about, 
such as whether it means anything to ask why we're here. I don't have to know an answer. 
I don't feel frightened not knowing things, by being lost in a mysterious universe without any purpose,
 which is the way it really is as far as I can tell."<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ― Richard P. Feynman</p>
